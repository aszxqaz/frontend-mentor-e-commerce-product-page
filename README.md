## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working through this project, I learned basics of using Flexbox layout and media queries. For example:

```css
@media (min-width: $first-breakpoint) {
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;
		align-items: center;

      padding-top: $mobile-padding;
	}
```

### Continued development

I am a new frontend developer and this is is my first project. In future I want to continue getting new experience in JavaScript and CSS by making new Frontend Mentor challenges.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/] - Another great resource to look up the information about using CSS and also JavaScript.
